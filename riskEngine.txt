###Risk Engine###

#What is does?#
Loads risk checks from docs/rules.yml (via rules_loader).
Runs those checks against normalized firewall rules (*.v01.jsonl from the parser).
Produces a list of findings in the agreed schema (docs/schema_findings_v0.1.md).

#How to run#
Use the CLI test runner:
python -m tests.run_engine_cli results/outside_fw.rules.v01.jsonl

or point it at a folder:
python -m tests.run_engine_cli results/normalized/

#What you’ll see#
Summary counts by severity and check ID.
A few one-line previews of findings.
If you want full findings, edit the runner to dump them into results/findings.debug.json.

#Output format#
Findings are already in the schema v0.1 (rule_id, check_id, severity, title, reason, src/dst, services, .....).
Engine only returns the findings in memory.

NEW csv findings for analysts simply add --csv
